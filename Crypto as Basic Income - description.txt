Crypto as Basic Income

General assumptions:

1. Cryptos generally are ideal instrument for Basic Income projects 
whether non-governmental (spontaneous) or organized by the state.

2. Currently, there are no technical barriers to construction of crypto 
and distribution of this crypto in the form of basic income.

3. Obviously, the real value of such a spontaneously distributed crypto 
will be zero or close to zero, which is not a problem, see below.

4. Suppose we distribute, say, 50,000 crypto units at very low cost 
(near zero per user) for most of the adult population and teenagers
in a particular country where the government "forgot" to print banknotes
or where the central bank prints banknotes at a rate of 1 million percent inflation.

5. After distribution, which does not necessarily accommodate 
the entire population (some citizens are unavailable, etc.),
you will inform traders that the purchasing power of XX billion 
crypto units is among citizens and that they can use 
this purchasing power for marketing purposes, for example:
"Come to our shop, pay 1 thousand crypto units and you will get a gift."

7. In this way, the market will gradually determine the market value 
for crypto units distributed through Basic Income.

8. There is no problem if the market sets very low value. 
Even value $ 0.00001 is better than nothing in countries 
where the government forgot to print currency.

9. The ideal starting point is an educated community 
where several administrators can work, such as university students.

10. We have the technical resources at our disposal, 
crypto is produced in the optimum quantity, and the abuse prevention 
system is also ready.

Conclusion: There are no objective technical barriers for this project.
